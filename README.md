# About me
- I am a simple and normal dude, I currently learn **Lua** and I will soon try other languages such as **Python** and **C(#, ++)** aswell of **Pluto**, a variation of Lua.
- I love to play GTA, Rocket League, Ghostrunner and occassionally Fortnite, which I wish to mod on these games somehow :)
- In terms of **me**, I am a shy and more or less dry individual, even though I like to meet new people, especially if they have the same interests as me.
